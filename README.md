# Learning SAP UI5

By Janet Gloria - 2023
**Welcome to my attempt on learning SAP UI5!**
I am following this tutorial by FreeCodeCamp: [SAP UI5 / Fiori - Full Course - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9cK2Z2JDLg)
This code is exactly the same, but it has some extra notes.
I am also uploading this on GitHub to try out pushing things to GitHub as well, and how to update my own code.

# How to Run

- **Make sure to have SAP UI5's Library Downloaded on your IDE**
  Just run this command in the Terminal: `npm install --global @ui5/cli`
- **Enable Scripts on your System by using PowerShell**
- **Start the app** using `ui5 serve`
- You can open Debugging tools by using `CTRL + Shift + Alt + P`
